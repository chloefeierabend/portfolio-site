# Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio site â€” built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This site is designed to showcase my work, experience, skills, and side projects in a clean, modern, and minimal layout. It also features a light/dark theme toggle and a parallax-style hero section. It is a work in-progress and I'm excited to see how this project goes!
